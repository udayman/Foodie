# Foodie
Foodie application being worked on with collaborators. The Foodie application provides ingredients to a shopping list from recipes the  user inputs. Another collaborator of mine has a copy of this application at anuritaG/recipe.

Recipe-master shows the most up to date flutter application. This application can be run on desktop with the use of a Android emulator.

The other directory on food pages was an earlier implementation of the application which remained in the repository when it was pushed.
