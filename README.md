# Foodie
Foodie application which I developed with two others, Jay Ray and Anurita Ghosh. The Foodie application provides ingredients to a shopping list from recipes the user inputs, as well as helpful instructional videos.
Recipe-master shows the most up to date flutter application. This application can be run on desktop with the use of a Android emulator.
To access the final application, install from play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=foodie.example.recipe.


**Since this application was not made in the usual Github fashion, the three of us have independently hosted our complete code on repositories like this one.
